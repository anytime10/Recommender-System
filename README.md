#Recommender Systems Project – Analysis of Customer Data  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the data and code for the group project of the course **"Analysis of Customer Data"** at **Tilburg University**. The objective of this assignment was to implement **Recommender Systems algorithms** on the [MovieLens dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grouplens/movielens-20m-dataset).  
A first data exploration was performed, than three models were applied, using the Surprise Package:
  
   - **Normal Predictor** – Baseline model.  
   - **KNNWithMeans** – k-Nearest Neighbors with mean-centered ratings.  
   - **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** – Matrix factorization approach for recommendation.
